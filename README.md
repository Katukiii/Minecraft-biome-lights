# Minecraft Biome Lights
A minecraft project that make an LED glow different colors depending on where your player resides!

# How it works:
This project runs on a nodered server. It uses minecraft nodes (see https://flows.nodered.org/node/@tomsith/node-red-contrib-minecraft/ for all the different nodes used for this project) to pin-point what biome the player is currently in.

Moving around different biomes in Minecraft will set different color values onto the LED strip.
All biomes are affected and have different color values.
